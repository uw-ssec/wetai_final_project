    "You may be wondering why we included the uncurated stimulation spike raster as a dataset for you to analyze. To see why, lets zoom in on the first few seconds of a spike raster for both uncurated and curated data. For most groups, you should look at the first 3-4 seconds of the recordings, however, group 3 should consider at least the first 13 seconds. Notice that you are able to see the stimulation patterns for your portocol in the uncurated data, but not the curated data. This is because the stimulation pulses were defined to be \"dubious neurons\" and were removed from the dataset. If you look closely at the uncurated spike raster, you will notice changes in stimulation voltages (for experiments that did this). Looking even more closely, you'll notice that different neural units will fire at different times based on which electrode is being stimulated (if different electrodes were stimulated at different times). You can use this spike raster from the uncurated stimulation recording to verify your stimulation protocol."
